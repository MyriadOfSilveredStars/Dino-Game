# Dino-Game
Another fun pygame project, this time my own interpretation of Chrome's no internet dinosaur game. I wanted to keep the basics of jumping and crouching, but add the ability to change your dino's design. Currently working on getting the day-night cycle to work correctly (it gets stuck on an eternal night!)
